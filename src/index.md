Once your key pages are fully mocked-up and you have an idea of the design direction, code a prototype in HTML and CSS that you can test and use as a blueprint to implement your website.

### Why an HTML & CSS prototype?

A prototype in HTML & CSS will allow you to quickly assemble responsive layouts, experiment with typography and grids, test interactions, and iterate cost-effectively to ensure that you build the best product for your users.
Prototyping is the foundation for coding static websites.

### A blueprint for developers

If the final build will be done by developers on a CMS, creating a prototype in HTML & CSS will allow you to:

<ol class="content-list">
  <li>Create a blueprint that developers can follow to implement the designs;</li>
  <li>Save time in preparing assets such as HTML files, including CSS.</li>
</ol>

### The 6 Simple Prototyping Steps

<em>The 6 Simple Prototyping Steps</em> is a breakdown of our process in 6 steps to help you implement <strong>high-performing</strong> interfaces <strong>quickly</strong> in HTML &amp; CSS following best practices in accessibility, progressive enhancement, performance and CSS.

These checklists and best practices have been created and curated based on 8 years of designing and implementing custom website designs.

### These are our prototyping principles
#### Take into consideration performance and accessibility

<ol class="special-list bg-primary-color">
   <li><a href="/setup/">Setup your project</a></li>
   <li><a href="/semantic-html/">Write Semantic HTML</a></li>	 
   <li><a href="/performance/">Consider performance</a></li>
   <li><a href="/css-architecture/">Use a clear CSS methodology</a></li>
   <li><a href="/modern-css/">Write Modern CSS</a></li>
   <li><a href="/testing/">Test, learn, iterate</a></li>	 	                   	          	          
</ol> 	              
 
### By following these principles, you will be able to:
 
*   Implement responsive designs using semantic HTML and Modern CSS;
*   Test early concepts effectively to avoid costly errors;
*   Optimise your website for better performance and accessibility;
*   Organise and maintain better your CSS;
*   Have a prototype ready to be implemented on a CMS;
*   Build user-friendly interfaces.

### Results if you don't follow the principles
#### If the product fails, you will fail too
