Most websites fail at reaching business objectives because the most critical flows and user stories haven’t been appropriately tested before putting the website in production.

### Problem: No testing is very expensive

Once in production, it’s **very costly** to revert — or fix any issues that compromise the user experience and the business behind the product.

Without testing your designs before putting your website live, you will likely build a product with **critical usability issues** that frustrate users, make the business lose money and be expensive to solve.

### Solution: Test your designs

To ensure you build the right product, **test your prototype with real users** and on **different devices** to check that everything works as expected.

Once you test and collect feedback, iterate your work until the work meets the desired objectives for users and the business.

With this approach, you will produce a website that will deliver massive value and won’t make changes or updates based on guesswork.

### Takeaways

*   Test your prototype early and often
*   Test your prototype with at least 1-3 real person
*   Test on different devices to see how your design adapts to screens
*   Use [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/), [Yellow Lab](https://yellowlab.tools/) or [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) to test performance
*   After running the tests, refine and iterate.
