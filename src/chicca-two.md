y name is Francesca Ritrovato. I was born in 1989 in Bari, in the south of Italy. I have a High School Diploma (Liceo classico), and a Masters in Economics and Ethical Finance. I have some working experience in an international non-profit making organization named AIESEC, where I actively took part in several volunteer activities.


I am conversant with Project Management, Small project budgeting, and creating volunteer projects. I speak English and Spanish quite fluently and Italian my mother language.

### My experience

At the end of my two months Erasmus programme in Germany, I attended a master course in Brescia, North Italy, where I acquired various notions in economics and Human Resources management.


Thereafter, I started an internship in a non-profit organisation in a hospital called Fondazione Poliambulanza. I was responsible for all fundraising activities, event planning, HR management including communication â€“ a responsibility which led me to the creation of a website for the organisation and became a financial asset to my employer.


Currently I am available for:

- Any front/back office position;

- A fundraising role in a non-profit organisation;

- Event planning, marketing and project management;

- HR activities in selection process and screening of cv's.
